#Soccer Shot Efficiency Project
Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize the shooting efficiency of soccer players in a match. It calculates the shooting accuracy based on the number of goals scored out of total shots taken and provides insights into shot efficiency based on various shot distances. The goal of the project is to help understand the effectiveness of shots in soccer matches and provide valuable insights for players, coaches, and analysts.
